## Linux

One of my summer projects was to switch from Windows to Linux. I have tested a number of distros, and now I have settled on Arch Linux. I am using OpenBox as my window manager, with a growing number of customized configuration files for every program I have installed.

## Dungeons and Dragons

I have started playing D&D this summer, which I had never played before. D&D is one of my favorite activities now, and I love sharing this hobby with other nerds.
